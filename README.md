## This project aims to analyze and predict Pfizer's stock price trends while providing actionable insights for financial analysis. By using XGBoost model,	it is a powerful supervised machine learning model that was designed to work with large and complicated dataset. 
### Key components of the project include:
1. Data Gathering: Collected stock prices using an API from Alpha to ensure accurate and up-to-date information for analysis. Additionally, gathered COVID-19 case data by year from a reliable source, such as the World Health Organization.

2. Feature Engineering: Create and integrate technical indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Simple Moving Average (SMA) to enhance prediction accuracy. These features will also be visualized to illustrate stock movement.

3. Macroeconomic Analysis: Examine the correlation between macroeconomic factors, such as COVID-19, which have a direct impact on Pfizer's stock price. Additionally, the analysis will include the correlation between Pfizer and other pharmaceutical companies like Merck and Amgen.

4. Volume Analysis: Investigate stock trading volumes and identify patterns linked to major events, such as earnings reports, that may influence price movements and COVID-19 vaccine announcement. 

5. Stock Price Prediction: Use historical data to predict future prices by applying technical indicators and leveraging the XGBoost model for enhanced performance. Additionally, evaluate the model's performance by visualizing the actual and predicted target prices over time and calculating the Mean Absolute Error.
